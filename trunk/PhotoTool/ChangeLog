	* Changed photo storage to use <base>/YYYY/MM/DD/HH-mm-ss as the base
	location for storing images, thumbnails, and working copies.  This will
	make it easier to find photos outside of PhotoTool, and faster for
	applications/operating systems that can't handle a large number of files
	in a directory.

	* Updated PhotoDialog to move the image files when the taken date is
	changed.

2005-01-09  Bryan Bulten <bryan@bulten.ca>

	* Added wxExifList and MetadataDialog for viewing exif metadata.

	* Re-vamped some of the icons to make their purpose a little clearer.

2005-01-08  Bryan Bulten <bryan@bulten.ca>

	* Added wxExif, a class for retrieving file exif information.  Loads
	metadata into a hash, no editing support provided yet.

2005-01-07  Bryan Bulten <bryan@bulten.ca>

	* Created new icons using InkScape.  Icons are in SVG format, and were
	converted to XPM.  Eventually these icons should be redone by someone with
	a little more skill ;-) .

2005-01-06  Bryan Bulten <bryan@bulten.ca>

	* Removed LibraryView, and send specific events to registered windows.
	This is cleaner, since handlers can just use their event tables, and no
	multiple inheritance is necessary.

2005-01-05  Bryan Bulten <bryan@bulten.ca>

	* Added GPL license statements to source files.

	* Added LibraryView interface for library views.  Adapted PhotoList and
	LookupList to use LibraryView for notifications.

	* Added EVT_PHOTO_SELECTED and EVT_PHOTOS_SELECTED.

2005-01-03  Bryan Bulten <bryan@bulten.ca>

	* Tested and fixed importing.  Changed to use modification file time
	instead of creation time.

	* Removed external boolean column from photo table.  The filename column
	is now used to indicate whether or not a file is stored externally.

	* Handled year change on TakenCalendar, and made minor refresh fix.

	* Moved repository to BerliOS for public development.

2004-12-31  Bryan Bulten <bryan@bulten.ca>

	* Began SlideShowDialog.  Can display slide show of selected album with
	specified transition time.

2004-12-30  Bryan Bulten <bryan@bulten.ca>

	* Finished drag and drop support from PhotoList.  Created PhotoDropEvent
	for drop handlers.  Photos can now be dragged onto locations or albums.

	* Fixed PhotoEvent constructor, so that event type was set correctly.
	Event now works as expected.

2004-12-29  Bryan Bulten <bryan@bulten.ca>

	* Began EditPage.  Just has a few empty buttons, no real functionality
	yet.  Still deciding whether or not to use a plugin interface for the
	components of the EditPanel.

2004-12-28  Bryan Bulten <bryan@bulten.ca>

	* Began wxBoxList and wxBoxListItem to simplify logic in the ThumbList
	class.

	* Added TestPage for testing out controls like ThumbList/wxBoxList.

	* Began drag and drop of photos from PhotoList.  Used scaled 64x64
	thumbnail for the cursor image.

	* Tested and fixed photo deletion.

2004-12-27  Bryan Bulten <bryan@bulten.ca>

	* Began ThumbList for displaying a list of thumbnails

	* Changed ArrayPhoto to PhotoArray, which is more clear.

	* Improved TakenCalendar for lookup page.

	* Added image list to LookupList, which now displays and edits categories
	and locations.

	* Removed TreePage, which replaced by LookupList.

	* Changed 'category' to 'album' throughout application.  This is probably
	easier to understand for users.

2004-12-26  Bryan Bulten <bryan@bulten.ca>

	* Added PhotoEvent, used for notifying listeners about changes to the list
	of photos to be displayed

2004-12-24  Bryan Bulten <bryan@bulten.ca>

	* Added CategoryList control.

	* Added LookupPage, which features a LookupList (categories and locations)
	and a TakenCalendar.

2004-12-23  Bryan Bulten <bryan@bulten.ca>

	* Changed lookup queries to use wxArrayString for easier memory
	management, and less syntatic sugar.

	* Added double click edit to ListDialog.

	* Added photo/category management to PhotoDialog and Library.

	* Used wxNotebook page changed event to update photo selection on new page
	from old page.

2004-12-22 Bryan Bulten <bryan@bulten.ca>

	* Created toolbar.  Currently using external .png files, since I couldn't
	get transparency to work automatically in wxDesigner.

	* Moved viewer to a ViewerPage.

	* Created a wxImage wrapper, Image, for additional functionality.
